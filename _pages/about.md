I'm Sepehr Bakhshi and currently a graduate student at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/), working with the Information Retrieval Group under the guidance of Professor [Fazli Can](https://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~canf/).
During my time at Bilkent, I've been working on data stream classification and information retrieval. These areas have fueled my interest in Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Data Mining.
In the academic journey so far, I've had the pleasure of working on various research projects exploring these fascinating topics. The experience has been both challenging and rewarding, and I look forward to continuing my exploration in these areas in the future.


How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
