I'm Sepehr Bakhshi and currently a graduate student at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/), working with the Information Retrieval Group under the guidance of Professor [Fazli Can](https://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~canf/).
During my time at Bilkent, I've focused on data stream classification and information retrieval. These areas have ignited my interest in Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Data Mining.
In the academic journey so far, I've had the pleasure of working on various research projects exploring these fascinating topics. The experience has been both challenging and rewarding, and I look forward to continuing my exploration in these areas in the future.

# Personal Interests
Apart from my professional life, I enjoy playing the piano. I occasionally upload videos of me playing on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6g-orkhaAI).
